1. No way to limit number of tasks running in paralle (e.g. chunks),
will be solved with concurrency policy (currently in progress)

2. No fault tolerance support, maybe also can be solved with policy for workflow (TBD with Renat)

3. No way to report progress in reverse type of workflow (e.g resolving by requires),
in direct type there is a way to specify *on-error*, *on-success* handlers.


Bugs
----------------
1. Need to *sync-db* after installing additional drivers
2. If task will fail with unxpected error -> whole workflow will be stuck in running


Good
-------
1. Independent tasks running parallel
2. Cross-orchestration between nodes is not an issue
3. Publish result of a task as an input to another task
4. Plugable drivers for a tasks
5. Suppor for timeout
