1. No way to limit number of tasks running in parallel (e.g. chunks),
will be solved with concurrency policy (currently in progress)
https://github.com/openstack/mistral/blob/master/mistral/engine/policies.py#L381

2. No fault tolerance support, maybe also can be solved with policy for workflow (TBD with Renat)
  - ignore_errors for some task
  - % success

3. No way to report progress in reverse type of workflow (e.g resolving by requires).

In direct progress can be reported by on-error, on-success, on-complete hooks


Bugs
----------------
1. Need to *sync-db* after installing additional drivers
2. If task will fail with unxpected error -> whole workflow will be stuck in running
3. Timeout is broken - on timeout engine failed with (OperationalError) database is locked
4. ^^ task that is timed out will run forever
5. Resuming workflow resulted in OperationalError: (OperationalError) database is locked None None\n

Good
----------------
1. Independent tasks running parallel
2. Cross-orchestration between nodes is not an issue
3. Publish result of a task as an input to another task
4. Plugable drivers for tasks
5. Retry policy support
